const Body = () => (
  <>
    <h1 id="title-h1">Front-end Developer Test Project</h1>
    <p>
      My goal is to make a page that looks exactly like this.
       page has the ability to create h1 text simply by tipying / then 1,
      then typying text, and hitting enter
      {' '}
    </p>
  </>
);

export default Body;
